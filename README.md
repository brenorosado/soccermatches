# âš½soccermatches
I created this project to practice my react skills.

This project shows data of 9 soccer/football leagues using https://www.football-data.org/ API. The standings and current matchday games are displayed in the interface, but it is possible to see the games from all other matchdays.] To run this project you'll need to sign up at https://www.football-data.org/ and use your API token in soccermatches/src/helpers/ApiHelper.js file.
